This web app translates your message into one of six Star Wars languages as provided by the [FunTranslation Star Wars API](https://api.funtranslations.com/). While you can type your message, if you have a microphone on hand you can also speak your message and have it transcribed to text thanks to the  [IBM Watson Speech to Text API](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/speech-javascript-sdk)!

Note that there may be errors in translation due to the limits placed on the free version of the Funtranslations API.
